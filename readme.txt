This plugin receives Instagram posts via IFTTT webhooks.

== Description ==

Use this plugin in conjunction with IFTTT to insert Instagrams into either your posts or a custom Instagram post type.

Unlike IFTTT’s Wordpress recipe, this will actually upload images to your server, which will give you greater flexibility in theme-making and, depending on your setup, possibly better performance. You will also get all the usual Wordpress thumbnails and a “featured image” thumbnail.

Thanks to Hugh Lashbrooke for his very cool Wordpress plugin template. https://github.com/hlashbrooke/WordPress-Plugin-Template
